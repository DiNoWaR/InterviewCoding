/**
 * A left rotation operation on an array of size  shifts each of the array's elements  unit to the left.
 * For example, if  left rotations are performed on array , then the array would become .
 * Given an array of  integers and a number, , perform  left rotations on the array.
 * Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers.
 * Sample Input
 * 5 4
 * 1 2 3 4 5
 * Sample Output
 * 5 1 2 3 4
 * Explanation
 * When we perform  left rotations, the array undergoes the following sequence of changes:
 * Thus, we print the array's final state as a single line of space-separated values, which is 5 1 2 3 4.
